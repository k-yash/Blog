            <ul class="list-non-bullet title  ">
                <li>
                   <h2> Prettier - Code formatter</h2>
                    <img class="img-b" src="1.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p class="para">As a Developer, keeping my code clean and properly aligned is a must — it’s non-negotiable. Having it properly indented and separated for better code reading is a priority, especially when dealing with long written code — separations with styles and functions and handlers are critical, not just for you but for your colleagues to read and work on.
                        This is super easy to set up, it will automatically format on its own the moment you hit save.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Bracket Pair Colorizer</h2>
                    <img class="img-b" src="2.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p class="para">Brackets are a pain for most developers, especially when working with huge projects. It’s even worse when you have spaghetti code. Trust me, bracket pair colorizer will save you all the stress.
                        With tons of nested long codes, especially in working with Javascript, it’s almost impossible to determine which brackets matches up with each other. Using bracket pair helps you find the opening and closing more easily. The fact that they’re colored makes your code more readable.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Live Share</h2>
                    <img class="img-b" src="3.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p class="para">Live share is one of the most advanced features in VSCode text editor. It’s perfect when working with team members. One of its functions is to allow every developer to share code snippets with other developers in real-time.
                        This is perfect and helps team collaborations become much more efficient and productive. Live Share allows the instant sharing of current projects even when debugging — how cool is that!
                        Collaborators don’t have to install any repositories, SDKs, or anything to connect with other developer’s current code. Everyone on the team can collaborate sessions to explore and fix things remotely.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Live Server</h2>
                    <img class="img-b" src="4.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p class="para">This extension is used for launching a development local server with a live reload feature for static and dynamic pages. This saves times for previewing the changes made to your source code by just making the changes in the VS code and saving the file. This will automatically refresh the browser and reflect the changes you have made in it, instead of us manually refreshing the browser page. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Debugger for Chrome</h2>
                    <img class="img-b" src="5.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p class="para">This extension is used for debugging JavaScript code in the Google Chrome browser for webpages in the Visual Studio Code environment. This extension is a lot more convenient than the Chrome console for debugging JavaScript code. To work with this, first install the extension and then set up the lauch.json settings for debugging the particular webpage you want to investigate.</p>
